# Convex Optimization with PYTHON

## Installation

[cvxpy homepage](<https://www.cvxpy.org/install/>) suggests pip install

```
pip install cvxpy
```

But sometimes it does not works well. Then I recommends below commands.

```
pip install -U pip 
pip install -U setuptools
cat requirements.txt | xargs -n 1 pip install
```
